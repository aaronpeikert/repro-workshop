## Properties we are after:

* fully automated
* independent of hardware
* independent of users
* continually verified

---

## Problems we want to solve:

1. copy&amp;paste mistakes
2. inconsistent versions of code or data
3. missing or incompatible software
4. complicated or ambiguous procedure for reproduction

---

## Software we will use:

1. R Markdown
2. Git
3. Docker
4. Make


---

## Services we will use:

* Posit Cloud (= RStudio Cloud)
* GitHub (≠ Git)
* GitHub Actions (∈ GitHub)

---

## TL;DR: This is almost impossible.

## Don't freak out.

## A Note on Computing Infrastructure

Usually you work on a private laptop. 
--
**Not today.**

For ease of setup we work in the Cloud. But confusingly we than ask another cloud provider to reproduce everything again somewhere else.

An incomplete list of computational infrastructures:

- laptops
- virtual machines
- single servers
- cloud computers
- high performance computers

## Note

GitHub might find it funky that 20 people push the same code from the same IP range (Posit Cloud).

If pushing code fails or asks for the password, we have triggered spam detection. In this case, we will have to repeat the GitHub handshake.

Generally the "handshake" only needs to be done once per machine (per token validity period).

## A note on workflow automation

This workshop uses a lot of automation to automate reproducibility, e.g., to configure software, fill templates, interact with Git/GitHub etc.

Among them:

* usethis
* gitcreds
* gh

And one of my packages:

* `repro`

These packages are "training wheels" and not required.

---
## `repro`-metadata

`repro` uses metadata in Rmds to infer (among other things) the software environment required. 

.todo[Trigger this mechanism using: `repro::automate()`]

.todo[Take a look at the newly generated file `Dockerfile`.]

.todo[Remove all, if any, python chunks.]

.todo[Commit changes. (Do not push.)]

.optional[Add any package of your liking to any Rmd and run `repro::automate()`]

.optional[Take a look at the file `.repro/Dockerfile_base` and friends. How would you change the R version used?]

---
## Build the image

GitHub action (GHA) is a cloud service that runs software when certain events trigger it.

.todo[Add a GitHub Action to build the required Docker image with `repro::use_gha_docker()`]

.todo[To trigger the action, commit and push your changes.]

.todo[Browse through the actions: `usethis::browse_github_actions()`]

***

.optional[Take a look at `.github/workflows/push-container.yml`. When is the action triggered?]

Missing ingredients will be generated,  
.small[*e.g., if the cleaned data is missing, the raw data is first cleaned.*]

Newer ingredients trigger updates,

Always the same "button" that triggers reproduction,  
.small[*e.g., regardless of programming language, file format, and intermediate steps.*]

## Make in action

.todo[Go to the terminal (`Alt + Shift + M`) and type `make inflation.pdf`]

## Advanced:

3. Read: Peikert, A., van Lissa, C. J., &amp; Brandmaier, A. M. (2021). Reproducible Research in R: A Tutorial on How to Do the Same Thing More Than Once. *Psych*, *3*(4), 836–867. https://doi.org/10.3390/psych3040053
4. Adept the project we created today, so that it becomes one of your projects (with your data, your analyses).

---

## Digging really deep:

3. Make: Read [Minimal Make](https://kbroman.org/minimal_make/), than simplify a complicated pipeline
4. Docker: get Docker installed, not fun
5. Latex: really not fun
--

6. Enjoy perfect reproducibility!
