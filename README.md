# Ensuring Reproducibility of complex data analytic projects

I will discuss in this workshop (2h) what reproducibility is, why you
should care about it and how you can achieve it. Spoiler: getting the
same results from the same data set, because you will be more
productive, just copy effective best practices from software
engineering. If you want to we’ll get our hands dirty using R in
[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud), but bystanders are also very
welcome.
